# :doughnut::calling: Click and collect

## (*Currently working on this project* ðŸ”§ðŸ”¨)

## :information_source: Description
This project was intended to be a brief assignment from my Professional Certificate in Web Development, but then I thought: what if instead of developing a section of something I start something from scratch? That way, once the assignment is over, I can continue working on it and experience the whole process, see the different topics from the course come together.


The original idea is to create a click-and-collect app for a small business. The clients will be able to explore the business's products, view each product details, and place orders for whatever they want. This ensures that the order is ready when they arrive, allowing them to collect and pay without unnecessary delays.


The initial design addresses the basic requirements of the original idea but is open to further modifications to extend the functionalities towards a more ambitious approach.
